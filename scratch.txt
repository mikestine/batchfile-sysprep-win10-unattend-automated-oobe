Go back to the command prompt and run the following command:

 
*** Dism /image:c:\temp\mountdir /add-package /packagepath:<path to the cumulative update>


for /f %%a in ('wevtutil enum-logs') do wevtutil clear-log "%%a"

DISM /image:c:\mountdir /Add-Package /PackagePath:"C:\MyFolder\Updates" /recurse
You can add drivers in the image with the following command:


 
Dism /Image:C:\temp\mountdir /Add-Driver /Driver:”c:\MyFolder\Drivers” /Recurse

Dism.exe /unmount-wim /mountdir:c:\temp\mountdir /commit
If you want to discard change, you and revert change, you can run the following command:


 
Dism.exe /unmount-wim /mountdir:c:\temp\mountdir /dicard
